# 📚 KIMU Documentation Index

Welcome to the official documentation for **KIMU** framework — *Keep It Minimal UI Framework*.

This space is dedicated to help you understand, install, and build with the `kimu-core` runtime and the broader KIMU ecosystem.

> "Minimal doesn't mean limited. It means intentional."


## 💡 About KIMU

KIMU is a minimal, web-native, modular framework built entirely on **Web Components**. It is designed for:

* Creating poetic and expressive interfaces
* Deploying fast, dependency-free applications

Whether you're crafting a dashboard, a kiosk interface, or a creative digital project — KIMU keeps your front-end clean, clear, and powerful.

> “Each extension is a thought. Each interface is a gesture.”
