# 🧩 kimu-core — The modular heart of KIMU

**kimu-core** is the minimal and modular engine behind [KIMU](https://github.com/unicoverso/kimu):  
an ultra-lightweight front-end framework, entirely based on **Web Components**, designed for **poetic**, **extensible**, and **living** interfaces.

This package represents the **runtime core** of the system, built to be **small, elegant, and self-sufficient**.

---

## 🌬️ What is KIMU?

**KIMU** – *Keep It Minimal UI* – is a **web-native** framework for those who want to build interfaces with **intention, lightness, and clarity**.  
Based on **web standards**, with no external dependencies, declarative and modular by nature.

> _"Each extension is a thought. Each interface is a gesture."_

## 🔧 What is `kimu-core`?

`kimu-core` is the **technical core** that starts, loads, and orchestrates the framework’s extensions.  
It includes the internal mechanisms to:

- 🧠 register and manage modular extensions
- 🧩 dynamically load HTML, JS, and CSS components
- 🖇️ connect elements via events, shared context, and styles
- 💾 handle shared local state and in-memory cache
- 🧱 support the creation of **declarative interfaces**, built only with Web Components

All this with no complex build process, no external dependencies, using modern **vanilla JavaScript**.

## ⚙️ Key features

- ✅ **Zero dependencies** – pure JS, ready to use
- 🔌 **Dynamic extension system** – self-loading HTML+JS+CSS modules
- 🧩 **Radical modularity** – every piece can be replaced or disabled
- ⚡ **Instant startup** – no heavy initialization
- 🌐 **Web-native** – leverages browser-native standards
- 🧱 **Declarative custom components** – no external frameworks required
- 🎯 **Composition-oriented** – every app is built as a collection of extensions

## ✨ What can you build with `kimu-core`?

Even with just this core package, you can:

- create a **standalone app** composed of dynamically loaded components
- build an **ultralight dashboard or kiosk interface**
- prototype **modular interactive experiences** (e.g., exhibitions, museums, embedded devices)
- orchestrate **self-configuring frontend extensions**, managed via dynamic manifests
- design **personalized environments**, themed and runtime-configurable

> It's a perfect foundation for tools, playgrounds, low-footprint UIs, or modular ecosystems.
