# 🔧 What is `kimu-core`?

`kimu-core` is the **technical core** that starts, loads, and orchestrates extensions in the [KIMU](https://github.com/UnicoVerso/kimu) ecosystem.

> "Minimal doesn't mean limited. It means intentional."

It includes everything needed to:

- 🧠 Register and manage modular extensions  
- 🧩 Dynamically load HTML, JS, and CSS components  
- 🖇️ Connect UI elements via events, shared context, and scoped styles  
- 💾 Handle shared local state and memory caching  
- 🧱 Support **declarative UI building** using only Web Components

No bundlers. No virtual DOM. No dependencies. Just modern **vanilla JavaScript**, intentionally designed.

> It’s the perfect foundation for modular ecosystems, creative interfaces, low-footprint apps, or poetic digital experiences.

## 🌿 Philosophy

> "Minimal doesn't mean lacking.  
> It means focusing on what truly matters."

KIMU encourages a design and development approach where every element has a reason to exist.  
No bloat, no unnecessary complexity — just pure functionality, elegantly presented.

KIMU follows the principle of essentialism:  
- Every element exists because it has meaning.  
- Every interaction is designed for clarity.  
- Complexity is embraced only when it serves the user.

> "No bloat.  
> No distractions.  
> Pure, meaningful interfaces."
